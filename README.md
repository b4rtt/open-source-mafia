# Open Source Mafia — Appeal to Hangar 13

We are a long-standing modding community that has kept the original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven alive ever since its release in 2002. Over the years, countless modifications, technical improvements, new car models, unofficial patches, and many other fan-made projects have been created purely out of enthusiasm.

Thanks to this effort, the original Mafia remains playable on modern systems and continues to be discovered by new players even today. The community has maintained the game's visibility and legacy for more than two decades — without expecting anything in return.

Many of the creators who helped shape the modding scene are still active, constantly updating and improving the game so that it can survive for future generations. This is why we publish this appeal:

**We respectfully ask Hangar 13 to release the original Mafia as an open-source project — including any preserved tools, editors, or resources that could help the community keep the game alive.**

We sincerely believe this would benefit both sides. Open-sourcing the game would allow Mafia to live on, reaching new audiences and ensuring its long-term preservation. For Hangar 13, it would be a powerful gesture of goodwill — a recognition of a community that has supported the Mafia series faithfully for over 20 years. It would generate positive attention, strengthen the studio's legacy, and align with similar actions taken by other game studios worldwide.

The original source code and internal tools likely no longer serve any practical purpose for the studio. Yet for the community, they could unlock entirely new possibilities. They would give a fresh spark to hundreds of modders, programmers, and fans who have spent years reverse-engineering the game simply to keep it functioning.

And to everyone who supports this initiative, we welcome your signature below.
